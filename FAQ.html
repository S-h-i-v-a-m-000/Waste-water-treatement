		<p><b>Q. What wastewater is comprised of?</b>
		<p><b>Ans.</b> The composition of wastewater is a function of its source. Domestic sewage/municipal wastewater is typically comprised of pathogenic microorganisms, biodegradable organics, nutrients (such as nitrogen and phosphorous), suspended solids, and may contain toxic compounds that may be carcinogenic. Industrial wastewater usually contains higher organic concentrations (e.g., BOD, COD, TOC, etc), heavy metals, and suspended solids. </p>
</p>
		<p><b>Q. What drives wastewater treatment?</b>
		<p><b>Ans.</b> Human health protection<p>

		Pathogens <br>
		Chemicals <br>
<br>
	 	Environmental Protection <br>
<br>
		BOD and COD <br>
		Nutrients (e.g., N and P) <br>
		Metals <br>
		Endocrine disrupting compounds (EDCs), pharmaceuticals, and personal care products (PPCP) <br>
 <br>
		Recover useful products <br>
 <br>
		Water (grey water, aquifer recharge, potable water) <br>
		Treatment chemicals (e.g., lime) <br>
		Energy (e.g., methane and hydrogen) <br>
		Fertilizer</p>
		
		<p><b>Q. What is biological wastewater treatment?</b>
		<br><b>Ans.</b> The removal of dissolved and particulate biological oxygen demand (BOD) and the stabilization of organic matter present in water can be achieved biologically using variety of microorganisms. They are responsible to oxidize the dissolved and particulate carbonaceous organic matter to mineral constituents of CO 2 and H2O, and additional biomass.
<br>
		v 1 (organic material) + v2O2 + v3NH3 + v4PO43- â†’ v5 (new cells) + v6CO2 + v7H2O
<br>
 		Where v i= the stochiometric coefficient</p>

		<p><b>Q. What are the typical biological processes for wastewater treatment?</b> <br>
		<b>Ans.</b> Suspended-growth processes <br>
		Attached-growth processes <br>
		Combined processes <br>
		Lagoon processes</p>

		<p><b>Q. What does biological oxygen demand (BOD) and chemical oxygen demand (COD) refer to?</b> <br>
			<b>Ans.</b>BOD: biological oxygen demand (BOD) is the amount of oxygen required by aerobic biological microorganisms to decompose organic material in a given water at certain temperature over a time period.COD: chemical oxygen demand (COD) is a measurement of the oxygen required to oxidize soluble and particulate organic matter in water using a strong oxidizing agent.</p>
			
		<p><b>Q. Why COD values are greater than BOD values?</b> <br>
		<b>Ans.</b> Values are always greater than BOD values because COD captures both biodegradable and nonbiodegradable substances, whereas BOD only entails biodegradable ones. </p>

		<p><b>Q. What does nitrification and denitrification refer to?</b> <br>
			<b>Ans.</b>Nitrification: The two-step biological process by which ammonium (NH 4+) is converted first to nitrite (NO 2-) and then to nitrate (NO3-). <br>
			Denitrification: the biological process by which ammonia (NO 3-) is converted to nitrogen (N 2) and other gaseous end products.</p> 
			
			<p><b>Q. Where does all the sewage go?</b> <br>
			<b>Ans.</b>All the sewage is collected through wastewater collection systems (combined or separate sewer), from which it is transferred to wastewater treatment plants (WWTP).  </p>

			<p><b>Q. What is the difference between suspended-growth and attached growth processes?</b> <br>
			<b>Ans.</b>In suspended-growth processes microorganisms are maintained in suspension within the liquid, whereas is attached-growth processes (i.e., fixed-film processes) microorganisms are attached to some inert medium, such as rocks, slag, or specific ceramic or plastic materials. </p>
